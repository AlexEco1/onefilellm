# Fix YouTube Transcript Test Error Output Issue

## Context
I have a test suite for OneFileLLM where the `test_youtube_integration` test is displaying error messages during execution but still passing. This is confusing because it shows:
```
Error fetching YouTube transcript for https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ: no element found: line 1, column 0
ok
 âœ“ PASSED
```

The test appears to be checking error handling by intentionally using a video that will fail transcript extraction, but the error output makes it look like something is wrong even though the test passes.

## Task
Please analyze and fix the `test_youtube_integration` test to make it clearer that:
1. The error is expected behavior being tested
2. The test is actually passing as intended
3. The output doesn't confuse users who run the test suite

## Requirements
1. **Preserve the test's functionality** - it should still test error handling for YouTube transcript fetching
2. **Suppress or redirect error output** during test execution so it doesn't appear in the console
3. **Add clear test documentation** explaining what the test is checking
4. **Consider renaming the test** to something like `test_youtube_error_handling` if it's specifically testing error cases
5. **Add assertions** that make it explicit what error conditions are expected

## Possible Approaches
- Use context managers or mock objects to capture error output
- Redirect stderr/stdout during the test
- Mock the YouTube transcript fetcher to avoid actual network calls
- Add comments and docstrings explaining the expected behavior
- Use unittest's `assertLogs` or similar to capture and verify error messages
- Split into separate tests for success and error cases if needed

## Example Structure
```python
def test_youtube_transcript_error_handling(self):
    """Test that YouTube transcript errors are handled gracefully.
    
    This test intentionally uses an invalid or restricted video ID
    to ensure error handling works correctly.
    """
    # Test implementation that suppresses error output
    # and explicitly checks for expected error behavior
```

## Success Criteria
- Running the test suite should not show confusing error messages for passing tests
- The test purpose should be immediately clear from its name and documentation
- Other developers should understand this is testing error handling, not a broken test
- The test should still effectively verify error handling functionality

Please provide the updated test code with clear explanations of the changes made.
